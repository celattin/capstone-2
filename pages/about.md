## About the Collection

This digital collection was created for the Capstone Project of Professor Maggie Dull's Fall 2021 section of LBSC671 (Creating Information Infrastructures) at the University of Maryland. It was created by Claire Lattin to catalog her personal vinyl collection. The collection includes vinyl from 28 different years, spanning from 1951-2021. There are 120 items in the collection, including one poetry recording. Primary genres of music represented are rock, pop, and folk, as well as subgenres within those three. In the future, the collection will continue to expand as more vinyl records are aquired.
